# Instructions

## Running all experiments

In the home folder:
```
./build_all.sh
./run_all.sh <Number of Iterations>
```

## Running specific experiment

Alternatively, you can build and run each test individually. For example, if you
want to run cpu test, just do the following:

```
cd cpu
./build.sh
./run.sh <Number of Iterations>
```

## Clean
Run the following command to clean all the existing building files. Most of time,
this is not necessary.
```
./clean_all.sh
```
