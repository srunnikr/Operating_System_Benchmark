./build_all.sh
./run_all.sh <Number of Iterations>
```

## Runnning specific experiment

Alternatively, you can build and run each test individually. For example, if you
want to run cpu test, just change to the cpu folder and do the following:

```
cd cpu
./build.sh
./run.sh <Number of Iterations>
```

## Clean
Run the following command to clean all the existing building files. Most of time,
this is not necessary.
```
./clean_all.sh
```
