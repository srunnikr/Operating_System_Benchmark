# Instructions

## Running all experiments

In the home folder:
```
./build_all.sh
./run_all.sh <Number of Iterations>
```

## Runnning specific experiment

Alternatively, you can build and run each test individually. For example, if you
want to run cpu test, just change to the cpu folder and do the following:

### Building

```
cd cpu
./build.sh
```
### Running tests
```
./run.sh <Number of Iterations>
```
Example
```
./run.sh 100000
```

## Clean
No need to clean. When you rebuild the project, the previous version will
be removed first.
